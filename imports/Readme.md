## Important Note
The RO slim used by CCO in v1.4 is derived from an old version of RO (2020-12-18). This is due to change introduced in the 2021-06-23 version of RO that changes the meaning of RO_0000052 & RO_0000053, such that it widens the range of entities that can bear (now \"characterize\") a SDC. This is inconsistent with BFO and therefore we do not accept the change.
